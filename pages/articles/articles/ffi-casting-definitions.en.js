**Updated: January 16, 2026**

## Introduction

These casting definitions are intended to help instructors and others with a strong interest in fly casting communicate more clearly. They are not necessarily intended to be teaching terms, and we certainly respect our colleagues' right to use whatever terminology they feel is appropriate for their students. This single set of definitions covers all overhead and anchored casts with fly rods. Some physics terms related to fly casting are also provided to help with a deeper understanding of casting.

## Fly Casting

Using a flexible lever to move and unroll a weighted line to propel an artificial lure.

## Loops

### Loop
The shape a fly line assumes as it overtakes the rod tip during a fly cast.

### Fly Leg
The moving section of fly line in a loop from the fly to the start of the loop nose.

### Rod Leg
The moving or stationary section of fly line in a loop from the rod tip to the end of the loop nose.

### Loop Nose
The curved section of fly line at the front of the loop which is the transition between the fly leg and the rod leg.

## Fly Leg Shapes

### Straight Fly Leg
A fly leg where the fly line and leader are relatively free from curvature from the loop nose to the fly.

### Convex Fly Leg
A fly leg with a dome shaped configuration curving away from the rod leg.

### Concave Fly Leg
A fly leg which is not straight and dips toward the rod leg.

### Trailing Loop
A loop which has a fly leg which is not concave, and crosses the rod leg.

### Tailing Loop
A loop with a concave fly leg, which dips towards and crosses the rod leg.

## Casting Movements

### Translation
A linear change in position of the rod butt.

### Rotation
An angular change in position of the rod butt.

### Casting Stroke
Rotation and/or translation of the rod butt sufficient to cause loop formation.

### Stroke Length
The distance moved by the rod butt during the casting stroke.

![Casting_StrokeLength.png](Casting_StrokeLength.png)

### Casting Arc
The angle change of the rod butt during the casting stroke.

![Casting_Arc.png](Casting_Arc.png)

### Stop
Deceleration of the rod resulting in loop formation.

### Rod Plane
The surface traced by the rod during a fly cast.

### Rod Tip Path
The straight or curved path travelled by the rod tip during a fly cast.

### Tracking
The lateral path of the rod tip during the casting stroke.

### Trajectory
The direction travelled by the loop relative to the horizon.

### Lift
Upward movement of the rod to reposition the fly line for the next action in a fly cast.

### Follow-Through
Forward and downward movement of the rod after the delivery cast.

### Timing
The moments in time when each casting action transitions into the next.

### Tempo
The rates of movement within a cast.

### Pause
The time period between casting strokes.

### 180 Degree Principle - Aerialized Casts
The intended rod tip path and fly line are closely aligned both laterally and vertically with the target at the start of each casting stroke.

### 180 Degree Principle - Anchored Casts
The delivery cast, D loop and the anchor are closely aligned laterally with the target.

## Rod Movements During the Pause

Rod movements during the pause can be accomplished with a combination of translation and rotation.

### Drift
Moving the rod tip in the direction of the current cast during the pause.

![Casting_Drift.png](Casting_Drift.png)

### Drag
Moving the rod tip in the direction of the next cast during the pause.

![Casting_Drag.png](Casting_Drag.png)

### Creep
Drag which contributes to a casting fault.

### Up/Down
Moving the rod tip up or down during the pause.

### In/Out
Moving the rod tip in (closer to the caster laterally) or out (further away) during the pause.

## Casting Terms

### Aerial/Overhead Cast
After the initial lift, aerialized forward and back casts are made until the delivery cast.

### False Cast
A forward cast followed by a back cast, both of which remain aerialized.

### Overhang
The amount of running/shooting line outside the rod tip during casting strokes.

### Point P
The point where the fly line suspended from the rod tip first touches the water.

### Anchor
The fly and fly line/leader in contact with the water at the bottom of the D loop.

### Anchored Cast
A cast whose back cast loop passes underneath the rod tip and forms an anchor and a D loop.

### Anchor Position
The position and layout of the anchor relative to the caster.

### Skipped Anchor
A fault where the anchor forms briefly then leaves the water too early before the delivery cast, moving away from the target.

### Blown Anchor
A fault where the anchor leaves the water prematurely during the delivery cast.

### Piled/Crashed Anchor
A fault where the anchor lands on the water resulting in slack in the fly line/leader.

### Bloody L Anchor
A fault where a portion of the fly line/leader forms approximately a right angle to the rest of the anchor.

### Level Line Drop
A fault in a D loop sweep causing the fly line/leader to land flat on the water.

### Trunking
A fault where downward rod movement at the end of a D loop sweep causes an excessively long anchor with point P behind the caster.

### Hooking
A fault where the D loop swings around and behind the caster.

### Connection Point
The junction of fly line/leader or fly line/shooting head line.

### D Loop
A round shaped back cast loop between the rod tip and the anchor of an anchored cast. Also used generically to refer to any shaped back cast loop in an anchored cast.

### V Loop
A pointed back cast loop between the rod tip and the anchor of an anchored cast.

### D Loop Sweep
The casting stroke that initiates the formation of the back cast loop in an anchored cast.

### Line Placement Move
A rod move made immediately after a lift to properly position the fly line on the water in preparation for the subsequent D loop sweep.

### Touch and Go Anchor Cast
An anchored cast where the fly line/leader first re-contacts the water after a lift and D loop sweep.

### Sustained Anchor Cast
An anchored cast that has a line placement move before the D loop sweep.

### Downstream Anchor Cast
An anchored cast in moving water where the anchor and D loop are positioned downstream of the caster; or in still water, where they are left on the same side of the caster as the fly line was prior to the lift.

### Upstream Anchor Cast
An anchored cast in moving water where the anchor and D loop are positioned upstream of the caster; or in still water, where they are positioned on the opposite side of the caster from the fly line prior to the lift.

### Circle Up
A circular upward motion connecting the D loop sweep and delivery cast by which the caster arrives at the key position.

### Key Position
The hand and arm position of the caster when starting the delivery cast.

### River Left / Left Bank
The river left bank when facing downstream.

### River Right / Right Bank
The river right bank when facing downstream.

## Casts and Techniques

### Delivery Cast
The final casting stroke of a fly cast which presents the fly.

### Mends
Manipulating the fly line layout by rod movement after the stop on a delivery cast.

- **Aerial Mends** — Mends made before the fly line/leader lands on the water.
- **Water Mends** — Mends made after the fly line/leader lands on the water.

### Shooting line
Releasing the fly line after the stop to increase the amount of fly line outside the rod tip.

### Slipping line
Increasing the amount of fly line outside the rod tip by releasing the fly line and moving the rod before or after a casting stroke.

### Straight Line Presentations
Casting strokes and/or mends that produce a straight fly line layout.

### Slack Line Presentations
Casting strokes and/or mends that produce a slack fly line layout.

### Curved Presentations
Casting strokes and/or mends that produce a curved fly line layout.

### Hauling

- **Single Haul** — Pulling the fly line through the rod guides during either the forward or back casting stroke.
- **Double Haul** — Pulling the fly line through the rod guides during consecutive casting strokes, after returning the line hand toward the rod hand during the pause.

### Continuous Tension Cast
A cast that maintains tension on the fly line through continuous rod movement.

### Oval / Belgian / Elliptical Cast
A continuous tension cast formed by a relatively horizontal back cast rod plane that transitions without pause to a more vertical rod plane on the forward cast.

### Roll Cast
An anchored cast without a substantial change of direction consisting of a lift, D loop sweep, circle up, and delivery cast in which the fly does not leave the water until after the delivery cast.

### Switch Cast
A touch and go anchored cast without a substantial change of direction consisting of a lift, D loop sweep, circle up, and delivery cast.

### Spey Cast
An anchored cast with a change of direction.

### Single Spey
A downstream direction change touch and go anchored cast consisting of a lift, fly line relocation move, then a D loop sweep, circle up and delivery cast.

### Double Spey
An upstream direction change sustained anchor cast consisting of a lift and upstream line placement move, followed by a downward rod move transitioning to a D loop sweep, circle up and delivery cast.

### Snap Cast
An upstream direction change sustained anchor cast consisting of a lift, a line placement move (rod moves upstream then reverses downstream), followed by an upstream rod move transitioning to a D loop sweep, circle up and delivery cast.

- **Snap C / Circle C / Circle Spey** — A snap cast whose line placement move consists of rod moving upstream then reversing downstream in a circular path.
- **Snap T** — A snap cast whose line placement move consists of rod moving upstream then reversing downstream in a relatively straight path.

### Snake Roll
A downstream direction change touch and go anchored cast consisting of a circular lift motion toward the target, then transitioning to a D loop sweep, circle up and delivery cast.

### Perry Poke
A rod move that introduces slack fly line to the water surface in front of the caster, generally aligned with the target direction, then a D loop sweep, circle up and delivery cast.

## Physics of Fly Casting

We invite instructors and other casting students seeking deeper technical understanding to explore this continuing education resource developed by the FFI Fly Casting Mechanics and Definitions Team. Certification candidates are encouraged to become familiar with the terminology that appears on the exams.

### Speed
How fast an object is moving.

### Velocity
Speed combined with the direction of motion of an object.

### Acceleration
The rate at which velocity changes over time. It can be positive, negative, or zero.

### Positive Acceleration
An increase in the velocity of an object. Commonly referred to as acceleration.

### Negative Acceleration / Deceleration
A decrease in the velocity of an object.

### Constant Acceleration
Velocity that changes at the same rate over time.

### Constant Velocity
Zero acceleration.

### Force
A push or pull on an object.

### Torque
A force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis.

### Mass
The amount of matter or substance that makes up an object.

### Weight
The result of gravity acting on mass.

### Work
Energy transferred to or from an object, calculated as force multiplied by the distance over which it acts.

### Energy
The capacity of an object to do work. Forms of energy include:

- Potential energy or stored energy
- Kinetic energy or working energy, calculated as one half of an object's mass multiplied by its velocity squared.

### Momentum
The momentum of an object is its mass multiplied by its velocity.

### Impulse
Momentum transferred to or from an object, calculated as force multiplied by the time over which it acts.

### Power
A measure of the rate of doing work or transferring energy, calculated as work done per unit time.

### Newton's Laws of Motion

**First Law: Inertia** — An object will continue in its current state of motion or rest until some net force causes a change in its velocity or direction of motion.

**Second Law: Force** — The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it. Expressed as force equals mass multiplied by acceleration.

**Third Law: Action/Reaction** — For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
