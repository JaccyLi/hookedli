# FFI Fly Casting Definitions

**Updated: Jan 16, 2026**

## Introduction

These casting definitions are designed to help instructors and others with a serious interest in Fly Casting communicate more clearly with each other. They are not necessarily intended to be teaching terms, and we of course respect our colleagues' right to use terminology they consider suitable for their students. This single set of definitions covers both overhead and anchored casts with all fly rods. Some physics terms pertinent to fly casting are provided as they may help provide a deeper understanding of casting.

The document is laid out in following sections and is followed by an [alphabetical index of terms](#index-of-casting-terms) linked to their definitions.

- [Fly Casting](#fly-casting)
- [Loops](#loops)
- [Fly Leg Shapes](#fly-leg-shapes)
- [Fly Casting Movements](#fly-casting-movements)
- [Rod Movements During Pause](#rod-movements-during-pause)
- [Casting Terms](#casting-terms)
- [Casts and Techniques](#casts-and-techniques)
- [Physics Terms for Fly Casting](#physics-terms-for-fly-casting)

We hope you find it helpful.

## Casts and Techniques

### Delivery Cast
The final Casting Stroke of a Fly Cast, which presents fly.

### Mends
Manipulating fly line layout by rod movement after Stop on a Delivery Cast.

- **Aerial Mends** - Mending before fly line/leader lands on water.
- **Water Mends** - Mending after fly line/leader lands on water.

### Shooting line
Increasing amount of fly line outside rod tip by releasing fly line after Stop.

### Slipping line
Increasing amount of fly line outside rod tip by releasing fly line and moving rod either before or after a Casting Stroke.

### Straight Line Presentations
Casting Strokes and/or Mends which produce a straight fly line layout.

### Slack Line Presentations
Casting Strokes and/or Mends which produce slack line layouts.

### Curved Presentations
Casting Strokes and/or Mends which produce a curved line layout.

### Hauling

- **Single Haul** - Pulling fly line through rod guides during either forward or back Casting Stroke.
- **Double Haul** - Pulling fly line through rod guides during consecutive Casting Strokes, after returning line hand towards rod hand during Pause.

### Continuous Tension Cast
A cast where continuous rod movement maintains tension in fly line.

### Oval / Belgiian / Elliptical Cast
A Continuous Tension Cast formed by a relatively horizontal back cast Rod Plane which then transitions without stopping into a more vertical Rod Plane on forward cast.

### Roll Cast
An Anchored Cast without a substantial change of direction consisting of a Lift, D Loop Sweep, Circle Up, and Delivery Cast in which fly does not leave water until after Delivery Cast.

### Switch Cast
A Touch and Go Anchor Cast without a substantial change of direction consisting of a Lift, D Loop Sweep, Circle Up, and Delivery Cast.

### Spey Cast

### Single Spey
An Upstream Touch and Go Anchor Cast with a change of direction, consisting of a Lift, a fly line repositioning movement, then a D Loop Sweep, Circle Up, and Delivery Cast.

### Double Spey
A Downstream Sustained Anchor Cast with a change of direction, consisting of a Lift and an Upstream Line Placement Move, followed by a downstream rod movement transitioning into a D Loop Sweep, Circle Up, and Delivery Cast.

### Snap Cast
An Upstream Sustained Anchor Cast with a change of direction, consisting of a Lift, a Line Placement Move in which rod moves upstream and reverses direction downstream, followed by an upstream rod movement transitioning into a D Loop Sweep, Circle Up, and Delivery Cast.

- **Snap C / Circle C / Circle Spey** - A Snap Cast where Line Placement Move consists of rod moving upstream and reversing direction downstream in a rounded path.
- **Snap T** - A Snap Cast where Line Placement Move consists of rod moving upstream and reversing direction downstream in a relatively straight path.

## Physics Terms for Fly Casting

We invite instructors and other students of fly casting seeking a deeper technical understanding to explore this Continuing Education resource developed by FFI Fly Casting Mechanics and Definitions Teams. Certification candidates are encouraged to make themselves familiar with terms which appear in their exams.

### Speed
How fast an object is moving.

### Velocity
Speed in combination with direction of motion of an object.

### Acceleration
The rate at which velocity changes over time. It may be positive, negative, or zero.

### Positive Acceleration
An increase in velocity of an object. Commonly referred to as Acceleration.

### Negative Acceleration / Deceleration
A decrease in velocity of an object.

### Constant Acceleration
Velocity that changes at same rate over time.

### Constant Velocity
Acceleration is zero.

### Force
A push or a pull on an object.

### Torque
A force that can cause an object to change its rotation about an axis.

### Mass
The amount of matter or substance that makes up an object.

### Weight
The result of force of gravity acting on a mass.

### Work
The energy transferred to or from an object, computed as force multiplied by distance over which it is applied.

### Energy
The capacity of an object to do work. Forms of energy include:

- Potential or stored energy
- Kinetic or working energy, computed as half an object's mass multiplied by square of its velocity.

### Momentum
An object's momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity.

### Impulse
The momentum transferred to or from an object, computed as force multiplied by time over which it is applied.

### Power
A measure of rate at which work is done, or at which energy is transferred, computed as work done per unit of time.

### Newton's Laws of Motion
**First Law of Motion: Inertia** — An object will continue its current motion or lack thereof until some net force causes its speed or direction of movement to change.

**Second Law of Motion: Force** — The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to net force acting on it. Expressed as force equals mass times acceleration.

**Third Law of Motion: Action/Reaction** — For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
